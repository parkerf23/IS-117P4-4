Deathstroke, aka Slade Wilson, is a killer higher that has brought even the Justice League to its knees and made gods beg for their lives at his feet. Slade agreed to undergo an experimental process that increased his mental and physical abilities to a superhuman level. Even though being a ruthless contract killer, Deathstroke, from time to time, has helped protect the world and, in his mind, followed a moral code when taking contracts. He can be identified by his signature red and blue mercenary armor wielding two deadly katanas. His superhuman strength includes a vast amount of other abilities, including exceptional martial arts abilities, combat strategy, durability, enhanced strength and speed, weapons expert, superhuman agility, master swordsman, and an incredible healing factor. As stated, Slade has gone toe to toe with the best of them, including Batman from time to time, but not as much as the Teen Titans. Slade has waged war on the Titans for his own personal reasons on multiple occasions.</p>

                            <p id="textP" class="card-text">Chosen as the original wielder of the Wizard Shazams powers, Teth-Adam was an ancient Egyptian slave. Dawning the name Black Adam, he took up the mantle of the Wizard. Black Adam was imprisoned for millennia by the same Wizard for misuse of his powers. Throughout history, his heroic actions include liberating his home of Kahndaq from its dictators and the Seven Sins. His banishment was due to his revolt against the Council of Eternity, murdering all except the Wizard Shazam, who then cast Adam to his imprisonment. Adam has a list of abilities that rival even the strongest heroes of the DC universe, including divine empowerment, the stamina of Shu, self-sustenance, speed of Horus, flight, superhuman agility, reflexes, the strength of Amun, wisdom of Zehuti, enhanced senses, power of Aten, electrokinesis, the courage of Mehen, accelerated healing, immortality, and magic being such a powerhouse Black Adam as has his weaknesses such as his abilities being nullified and his inability to revert to his mortal form without fading into dust. Adam's must-hatted foe is the hero Shazam aka Billy Baston. He is the current wielder of the Wizard Shazams powers.</p>
