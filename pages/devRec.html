The world is on the brink of WW3, between the Amazons and the Atlantians. Whole countries were wiped from the map after being caught in the middle of this war. Now it's up to Berry to reclaim his abilities along with Batman (Thomas Wayne) to help save the world and correct the timeline before it all comes to an end.</p>

Blow after blow causing Superman to bend to the monster's power, beaten and bloody, Clark makes a last-ditch effort to destroy the beast once and for all. But it comes at the cost of his own life in the process. Now, with a defeated Doomsday and the death of Earth's guardian, how will life go on?</p>

The League falls right into his trap, and they won't be coming back this time. Darkseid unleashes his Paradooms that kill most of the League. Now that Darkseid has successfully conquered Earth, how will the remaining Justice League members save the planet?</p>

On a dark and gloomy night, a man by the name of Black Hand stands over the grave of Bruce Wayne. He pulls the skull of Bruce from the dirt in one and a black lantern power battery in the other. This is the beginning of the end. As the power battery begins to charge, a hoard of black lantern rings scatters across the stars. A voice calls out, "The dead shall rise." Once dead beings are brought back from the grave all across the universe, spreading death across the galaxy. The rings finally reach Earth, and once dead, heroes and villains are reanimated to do the black rings bidding. "John Jones of Mars rise," "Author Curry rise." Once reports of these rings reach Hal and Berry, they visit where it started at Bruce's grave only to be attacked and chased by black rings. They were able to get away from the rings and gather up other heroes and villains to figure out a solution to this now universal threat.</p>

He begins his rampage, finally leaping into the core of Apokolips to bring the planet to an end. At this moment, Victor boom tubes himself back to Earth but forgets one thing to shut his outgoing single off. It was too late. The corrupted anti-life equation spread through the signal reach to the farthest parts of the globe. It was infecting anyone in front of a screen, driving them into a murderous rage, turning Earth as we know it into a living hell. Now it is up to what's left of the League to figure out how to stop this rampaging techovirus.</p>

The events fall into motion, first baiting Clark by kiddnaping Lois Lane and dousing him in the kryptonite feartoxin mixture causing him to see things that arent really their. All of a sudden Doomsday appears and the battle begins. Clark not having the time or patient grabs the monster and rockets him to the uppermost atmosphere. At that time Clark snaps out of the effects of the concoction and hears the sounds of two hearts stop. Noticing that at that moment he had just killed Lois and thier unborn child, then triggering the switch to Jokers nuke which was linked to Lois's and the babys heartbeat. The Joker has broken The Man of Steel, driving him to break his moral code. In a fit of rage Clark kills the Joker, setting him on his new path of the Regiem.     </p>
