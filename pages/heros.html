Now an earthling known as Clark Kent, he is born with god-like abilities due to his Kryptonian DNA and its effect from the Earth's yellow sun. With these newfound powers, Clark dawns on the mantle of Superman, the protector of Earth. He must now take on this heavy responsibility. His list of powers consists of solar energy, cosmic energy, soul energy absorption, superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, senses, flight, heat vision, superflare, interstellar travel, invulnerability, and super-breath. Superman sounds invincible, but he has a list of weaknesses such as kryptonite, magic, solar energy dependency, sensory overload, radiation poisoning, and power limitation. Of course, being such a powerful hero attracts much attention from super-powered villains. But one villain stands out amongst the rest, Lex Luther, Superman's arch-enemy</p>

Before she took up the mantle of Wonder Woman, she was known as Diana Prince, daughter to the Amazon's. She was sent out into man's world as an ambassador to the Amazonian people. She stands as a beacon of hope to all who find themselves in need. Her list of abilities consists of super-strength, invulnerability, flight, combat skill, combat strategy, superhuman agility, healing factor, and magic weaponry. Her weaknesses consist of Bracelets of Submission, Lasso of Truth, firearms, blades, old Gods, dimensional travel, Bind of Veils, Scarecrow's Fear Gas, and poison. Diana has a hefty roster of super-villains such as her sister Cheetah and Ares the God of War.</p>

                                <p id="textP" class="card-text">Hal Jordan, selected by the guardians of the power battery of Will power, was chosen to become the Green Lantern of Earth. Hal has always dreamed of becoming a fighter pilot as a young boy. It wasn't until he was kicked out of the Air Force and came upon a crashed alien ship with a dying Green Lantern inside known as Abin Sur. With his dying words, Abin entrusted Hal with the power of his Green Lantern ring, forever changing his life. Now gifted with such immense power, Hal is the Green Lantern of sector 2814. He is tasked with protecting Earth and his entire sector from impending threats and evil with willpower. Hal's abilities only stem from what his imagination can create through the ring. His power is not limited to constructs but includes aviation, indomitable will, leadership, hand-to-hand combat, and mechanical engineering. With that being said, his list of weaknesses is as long as normal human beings when he isn't wearing the ring. When he is wielding the ring, the speed force and the yellow ring of fear are his most potent weakness. Being an intergalactic police office, he has racked up a long list of enemies. Still, the two that stand out the most are Sinestro and Parallax.</p>

                                <p id="textP" class="card-text">He was known to many as the foul-mouthed occult detective who is always chain-smoking cigarettes. He hails from Liverpool, England, and is more likely to be an anti-hero than a hero. He has been a member of the Justice League Dark, Newcastle Crew, and the Trenchcoat Brigade. He delves into the mystical arts, battles his far share of angels and demons, and is hated by all above and below. John's powers include an immense knowledge of the occult, expert user of magic, genius-level intellect, expert tactician, master con artist, and a skilled detective. With an attitude like John's, you tend to create a lot of enemies, including The Great Darkness, Gabriel, Papa Midnite, and Nergal.</p>
